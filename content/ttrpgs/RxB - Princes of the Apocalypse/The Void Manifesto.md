# [[The Void Manifesto]]

The Void Manifesto is a collection of writings attributed to an anonymous sage who claimed to have received visions from the Great Old One known as Tharizdun, the Chained God. Tharizdun is a being of utter madness and entropy, who seeks to destroy all existence and return everything to the primordial nothingness. The Void Manifesto is a radical and nihilistic doctrine that advocates for the annihilation of the self and the world, as the only way to escape the suffering and futility of life. The Void Manifesto is divided into four chapters, each dealing with a different aspect of the philosophy:

The First Chapter: The Illusion of Reality. This chapter argues that the world is a false and deceptive construct, created by the gods and other powerful beings to enslave and manipulate the mortals. The chapter claims that the world is full of contradictions, inconsistencies, and paradoxes, and that nothing can be trusted or verified. The chapter also asserts that the self is a delusion, a product of the ego and the senses, and that there is no true identity or purpose for anyone.

The Second Chapter: The Folly of Morality. This chapter denounces the concepts of good and evil, law and chaos, as arbitrary and meaningless labels, imposed by the gods and the society to control and judge the mortals. The chapter states that morality is a hindrance and a distraction, and that it prevents the mortals from seeing the truth and acting on their own will. The chapter also rejects the notions of honor, duty, compassion, and justice, as illusions and weaknesses, and that they only lead to suffering and regret.

The Third Chapter: The Vanity of Knowledge. This chapter ridicules the pursuits of science, magic, art, and religion, as futile and vain attempts to understand and master the world. The chapter claims that knowledge is a curse and a burden, and that it only breeds more ignorance and confusion. The chapter also warns that knowledge is dangerous and corrupting, and that it attracts the attention and the wrath of the gods and other enemies. The chapter advises the mortals to abandon their curiosity and their creativity, and to embrace their ignorance and their insignificance.

The Fourth Chapter: The Path of Oblivion. This chapter outlines the ultimate goal and the method of the philosophy, which is to achieve the state of oblivion, the complete and irreversible erasure of the self and the world. The chapter explains that oblivion is the only true peace and freedom, and that it is the natural and inevitable end of all things. The chapter also instructs the mortals on how to attain oblivion, by renouncing their attachments, their emotions, their thoughts, and their actions, and by surrendering themselves to the will and the power of Tharizdun, the Chained God. The chapter promises that those who follow the path of oblivion will be rewarded with the ultimate gift of nothingness, and that they will join Tharizdun in his eternal slumber in the Void.

The Void Manifesto is a rare and obscure text, mostly shunned and feared by the mainstream society and the religious authorities. The text is considered heretical, blasphemous, and dangerous, and its possession and dissemination are often punishable by death. The text is also sought after by some cults and sects, who worship Tharizdun and his servants, and who plot to unleash his power and bring about the end of the world. The text is also of interest to some scholars and philosophers, who study it as a curiosity and a challenge, and who debate its validity and its implications.al planes are the realms of pure elemental matter and energy, where the forces of air, earth, fire, and water shape the landscape and the creatures that dwell within. The elemental planes are connected to the Material Plane, the world of mortals, by the Elemental Chaos, a turbulent region of clashing elements and primal magic. The elemental planes are also home to the genies, powerful beings that can grant wishes and manipulate the elements.

The Elemental Plane of Air is a vast expanse of sky, where clouds, winds, and storms rage endlessly. The plane is inhabited by creatures that fly, glide, or float, such as aarakocra, air elementals, djinn, and rocs. The plane has no solid ground, except for a few floating islands of earth or ice. The plane is also the source of the magic of air, which can be used to create illusions, manipulate sound, and control the weather1.

The Elemental Plane of Earth is a realm of solid stone, where mountains, caverns, and tunnels form a labyrinthine network. The plane is populated by creatures that burrow, dig, or tunnel, such as earth elementals, dao, dwarves, and xorn. The plane is also rich in minerals, gems, and metals, which attract miners and treasure seekers. The plane is also the source of the magic of earth, which can be used to shape stone, create walls, and cause earthquakes1.

The Elemental Plane of Fire is a domain of flames, where volcanoes, lava, and ash create a scorching environment. The plane is home to creatures that thrive in heat, such as fire elementals, efreet, salamanders, and phoenixes. The plane has no water, except for a few pockets of steam or smoke. The plane is also the source of the magic of fire, which can be used to create light, heat, and explosions1.

The Elemental Plane of Water is a world of oceans, where waves, currents, and tides shape the aquatic landscape. The plane is inhabited by creatures that swim, dive, or float, such as water elementals, marids, merfolk, and kraken. The plane has no air, except for a few bubbles or pockets of gas. The plane is also the source of the magic of water, which can be used to heal, cleanse, and freeze1.

The elemental planes are the foundation of the cosmos, and the origin of the four common elements. They are also the realms of the genies, who rule over their respective planes and often interact with mortals. The elemental planes are both wondrous and dangerous, offering great rewards and perils for those who dare to explore them.
