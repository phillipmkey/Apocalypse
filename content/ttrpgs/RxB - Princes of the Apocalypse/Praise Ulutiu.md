# [[Praise Ulutiu]]

Ulutiu is the god of glaciers, polar environments, and arctic dwellers. He was once a powerful and benevolent deity, who created the Great Glacier to protect the lands of the north from the encroaching evil of the phaerimm. However, he sacrificed himself to seal the glacier, and fell into a deep slumber. His body became the island of Alaron, and his blood became the Sea of Moving Ice. He is worshiped by the ulutiuns, a race of humanoids adapted to the cold, who believe that he will one day awaken and restore the balance of the world. He is depicted as a muscular man with white hair and beard, wearing a fur cloak and holding a spear. His holy symbol is a white bear paw
