# [[Vizeran DeVir]]

*Guided by visions, Vizeran DeVir created four mighty weapons imbued with Elemental Evil: the spear [[Windvane]], the dagger [[Tinderstrike]], the trident [[Drown]], and the war pick [[Ironfang]]. He left these weapons on the altar of the Elder Elemental Eye for their fated bearers to discover.
