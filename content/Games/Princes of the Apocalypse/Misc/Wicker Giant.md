# [[Wicker Giant]]

The Wicker Giant is a ritual that some druids claim can restore natureâ€™s balance in the troubled [[Dessarin Valley]]. According to the rumor, the ritual involves burning a large wicker statue filled with living men and animals, as a sacrifice to the gods of the elements. The rumor also says that a druid named [[Elizar Dryflagon]] knows the secret of the Wicker Giant, and has invited others to join him at the Scarlet Moon Hall, where he plans to perform the rite.
