# [[Cult of the Black Earth]]

Leader carries [[Ironfang]]
Operates out of the [[Sacred Stone Monastery]]

Bruldenthar confirms that [[Cult of the Black Earth|earth cultists]] ambushed the Mirabar delegation south of Beliard, slaying most of their guards. [[Cult of the Black Earth|Earth cultists]] and their captives were ferried across the Dessarin River by pirates who received the sageâ€™s beloved books as payment. Bandits flying on giant vultures ambushed the earth cultists somewhere in the Sumber Hills. The bandits captured the delegate Deseyna Norvael. Bruldenthar and the rest were brought to the Sacred Stone Monastery. The sage was put to work, but delegates Rhundorth and Teresiel were taken below to an unknown fate.
