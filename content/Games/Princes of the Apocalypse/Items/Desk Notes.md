My Lord

I have updates for you on those trouble makers.  They have yet to give their group any sort of name, they are still just a miscellaneous unorganized group of "adventurers".

They have chased that Heretic Earth Cultist Larakh from the Tomb.

They gained entry into the Air spire and obtained favore with the cultists there after subdueing a mated manticore pair that the [[Feathergale Society|fethergale knoghts]] had been tormenting for months.

As you can see they continue to unwittingly do your bidding.

They next plan to obtain entrance into the keep and attack you in the great hall.  I would have plenty of reavers around, and a few of those worthless bandits.  The [[Echo|noseless one]] will attempt to break Carls will to join thier siade, but you know you have conditioned your subjects well, and this will not work.  My visions show Carl is loyal until death.

You must not crush them.  Give your Spare key to Ushnora.  These "visitors"  are your servants and the most loyal to [[Gar Shatterkeel|Gar]]

Several groups have setup camps on the slopes below the Hall

Atmosphere here seems "festive" even.  Many druids are present.
