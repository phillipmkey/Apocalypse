# [[Book - The Scrolls of Narvil]]

After the Creator had forged the world and made the dwarves, he became weary and slept. Some Lesser Gods, jealous of the Creator's skill, bound him as he slept. They heated the Great Forge to make races in their own likenesses, men, and elves. These they placed upon the world.
 
But they fell to arguing among themselves over which part of the world should be given to their peoples. The clamor of dispute woke the Creator who saw what they had done and became angry. But they laughed at him and bound him fast and swore he would never be released.

They fueled the fire of the Eternal Forge and continued to work. However, they did not know how to control the Great Forge and it became too hot. Great globules of molten stone flew into the air and fell to the earth. As they fell, the Creator breathed on them to cool them so that his people would not be injured. The force of his breath gave life to the molten fragments and these became dragons.

And so, of all the creatures of the earth, only the dwarves and the dragons were made by the Creator. Dwarves by the skill of his hands, and dragons by the power of his breath.

The Creator tried to break his bonds, but they were too secure. He argued with the Lesser Gods but they would not listen. "You cannot rule the world unless you can work the forge," he warned.

Sometimes when the forge became too hot or too cold, he gave the Lesser Gods advice, "add more air", "use less fuel". They laughed at him for his weakness in telling the secrets of the forge. Again he warned: "One day, the forge will burn beyond your control and the world will be seared by the heat of its flames. Then you shall free me or all will perish, even we. Then will I bring justice to the world you have abused. And my people shall be saved from your waging of war."

Beware the ways of man. He is greedy and avaricious beyond understanding. He seeks to possess wealth and riches, but most of all power over others. It is our duty to resist the mad lust of humankind to dominate other races. Not all men are evil, but the worst are their leaders who lead them into wars against us. It is written that only through the power of mithral can we protect our halls.
