# [[History of the Holy Order of Samular]]

Samular Caradoon was a legendary paladin of Tyr, the god of justice, who lived in the 10th century DR. He was the founder of the Holy Order of Samular, a knightly order dedicated to upholding the law and defending the innocent. He was also the youngest of the three Caradoon brothers, who were renowned for their heroism and faith in the Second Troll War.

Samular was born in Waterdeep, the City of Splendors, to a noble family of Illuskan descent. He had two older brothers, [[Renwick Caradoon|Renwick]] and [[Amphail Caradoon|Amphail]], who also became famous in their own right. Renwick was a powerful wizard who studied the secrets of the Weave, while Amphail was a paladin who became the lord of the town that bore his name. Samular followed in Amphail’s footsteps and became a paladin of Tyr, the Maimed God, who had sacrificed his hand to uphold his oath.

Samular’s fame and glory came during the Second Troll War, a conflict that lasted from 940 DR to 952 DR, and involved the invasion of the North by hordes of trolls and other monstrous creatures. Samular led the Knights of Tyr, a group of paladins and warriors who fought bravely against the enemy. He was known for his courage, his skill, and his devotion to Tyr. He was also respected by his allies and feared by his foes. He earned the title of Defender of the North, and became a symbol of hope and justice for the people of the region.

Samular’s greatest achievement was the Battle of the Burning Cliffs, which took place in 952 DR, and marked the end of the war. Samular and his knights, along with other forces from Waterdeep, Silverymoon, and the dwarves of Citadel Adbar, faced the troll army at the edge of a cliff overlooking a river of lava. The battle was fierce and bloody, and many lives were lost on both sides. Samular himself was wounded by a troll chieftain, who managed to break his shield and stab him in the chest. However, Samular did not falter, and with his last strength, he plunged his sword into the troll’s heart, killing him. He then collapsed on the ground, surrounded by his loyal knights.

Samular’s death was mourned by many, especially by his brothers, who had also fought in the war. **[[Renwick Caradoon|Renwick]], who had become an archlich**, a powerful undead wizard, vowed to honor his brother’s memory and protect his legacy. He took Samular’s body and his sword, and buried them in a secret tomb in the Dessarin Valley, near the town of [[Summit Hall]]. He also placed a powerful enchantment on the tomb, to prevent anyone from disturbing his brother’s rest. He then left the North, and went into hiding, seeking to learn more about the ancient evil that had caused the war.

[[Amphail Caradoon|Amphail]], who had become the lord of Amphail, a town north of Waterdeep, also paid tribute to his brother. He donated a large sum of money to the church of Tyr, and asked them to create a new order of paladins in Samular’s name. He also gave them Samular’s shield, which had been broken by the troll chieftain, as a symbol of their oath. The church agreed, and founded the [[Holy Order of Samular]], a knightly order that followed Samular’s example and teachings. The order was based in [[Summit Hall]], near Samular’s tomb, and became one of the most respected and influential organizations in the North.

Samular Caradoon’s legacy lives on to this day, as his order continues to uphold the law and defend the innocent. His tomb is also a sacred site, where many pilgrims and adventurers come to pay their respects and seek his blessing. Samular is revered as a saint by the followers of Tyr, and as a hero by the people of the North. He is remembered as a paragon of justice, a champion of the weak, and a defender of the land. He is Samular Caradoon, Defender of the North, brother of Renwick, who is currently interred with other knights of Samular in [[Summit Hall]].
