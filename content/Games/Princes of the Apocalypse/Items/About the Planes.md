# [[About the Planes]]

## About the Planes

The elemental planes are the realms of pure elemental matter and energy, where the forces of air, earth, fire, and water shape the landscape and the creatures that dwell within. The elemental planes are connected to the Material Plane, the world of mortals, by the Elemental Chaos, a turbulent region of clashing elements and primal magic. The elemental planes are also home to the genies, powerful beings that can grant wishes and manipulate the elements.

The Elemental Plane of Air is a vast expanse of sky, where clouds, winds, and storms rage endlessly. The plane is inhabited by creatures that fly, glide, or float, such as aarakocra, air elementals, djinn, and rocs. The plane has no solid ground, except for a few floating islands of earth or ice. The plane is also the source of the magic of air, which can be used to create illusions, manipulate sound, and control the weather1.

The Elemental Plane of Earth is a realm of solid stone, where mountains, caverns, and tunnels form a labyrinthine network. The plane is populated by creatures that burrow, dig, or tunnel, such as earth elementals, dao, dwarves, and xorn. The plane is also rich in minerals, gems, and metals, which attract miners and treasure seekers. The plane is also the source of the magic of earth, which can be used to shape stone, create walls, and cause earthquakes1.

The Elemental Plane of Fire is a domain of flames, where volcanoes, lava, and ash create a scorching environment. The plane is home to creatures that thrive in heat, such as fire elementals, efreet, salamanders, and phoenixes. The plane has no water, except for a few pockets of steam or smoke. The plane is also the source of the magic of fire, which can be used to create light, heat, and explosions1.

The Elemental Plane of Water is a world of oceans, where waves, currents, and tides shape the aquatic landscape. The plane is inhabited by creatures that swim, dive, or float, such as water elementals, marids, merfolk, and kraken. The plane has no air, except for a few bubbles or pockets of gas. The plane is also the source of the magic of water, which can be used to heal, cleanse, and freeze1.

The elemental planes are the foundation of the cosmos, and the origin of the four common elements. They are also the realms of the genies, who rule over their respective planes and often interact with mortals. The elemental planes are both wondrous and dangerous, offering great rewards and perils for those who dare to explore them.
