# [[Khalreshaar Devotional]]

Khalreshaar is the collective name for the three earth goddesses of the Bedine, a nomadic people of the Anauroch desert. They are Angharradh, the mother goddess of fertility and life; Kozah, the goddess of storms and rain; and Nula, the goddess of death and decay. They are seen as aspects of the same divine force, and they are revered as the source of all that is good and necessary for survival in the harsh desert. They are depicted as three veiled women, each wearing a different color: green for Angharradh, blue for Kozah, and black for Nula. Their holy symbol is a triangle with a circle in the center
