# [[Sacred Stone Monastery]]

- A lich may still live here
- There's a temple below
- Legend says it was haunted.
- The monks don’t like people are reclusive.
- Rumors are they capture people and take them somewhere.
	- We now know they take people and make Warforged out of them to work in the mines

> Earth cultists ambushed the Mirabar delegation south of Beliard, slaying most of their guards. Earth cultists and their captives were ferried across the Dessarin River by pirates who received the sage’s beloved books as payment. Bandits flying on giant vultures ambushed the earth cultists somewhere in the Sumber Hills. The bandits captured the delegate [[Deseyna Norvael]]. Bruldenthar and the rest were brought to the -[[Sacred Stone Monastery]]. The sage was put to work, but delegates Rhundorth and Teresiel were taken below to an unknown fate.
