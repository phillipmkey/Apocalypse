# [[Feathergale Spire]]

- [[Feathergale society]] hangs out here. They're related to the Air cult
- Found a letter here from [[Aerisi Kalinoth]], who apparently leads the Air cult.
	- The letter references a "noblewoman from Waterdeep", who was apparently one of the caravan members the Air dudes stole from the Earth dudes after the Earth dudes attacked the caravan
	- [[Aerisi Kalinoth|Aerisi]] doesn't seem to be a fan of the [[Cult of the Black Earth]]
