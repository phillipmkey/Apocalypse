# [[Eann]]

Eann, A cattle drover met the delegation on the Dessarin Road about ten miles south of town, a few hours after they left. Later that day he saw a group of five warriors in sky-blue armor and white cloaks, flying on giant vultures. The aerial riders flew overhead and turned south, heading in the same direction as the delegation. Eann, a cattle drover drinking here, tells this tale to anyone who listens.
