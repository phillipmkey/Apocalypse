## Letter 1

My dear Elizar,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to you to express my concerns about the recent activities of the cult. I fear that we are losing sight of our original goals and becoming too obsessed with power and destruction. I know that you share my doubts and reservations, and I urge you to speak up and take action before itâ€™s too late. Remember that we are not just servants of Imix, but also guardians of nature and protectors of the balance. Let us not forget our duty and our honor.

Yours truly,

ESoI

## Letter 2

Elizar,

I have received your report about the progress of the Rite of the Wicker Giant, and I must say that I am impressed and pleased. You have proven yourself to be a loyal and capable leader of the cult, and I have no doubt that you will succeed in your mission. However, I must remind you that time is of the essence, and that we cannot afford any delays or setbacks. The elemental princes are waiting for us, and we must not disappoint them. Keep up the good work, and you will be rewarded.

Yours truly,

V

## Letter 3

Elizar,

I have some disturbing news to share with you. It seems that there are some traitors and spies among us, who are working against our cause and sabotaging our plans. I have reason to believe that they are hiding in the nearby town of Red Larch, and that they are planning to attack us soon. I urge you to be vigilant and cautious, and to take all necessary measures to protect yourself and the cult. You are one of our most valuable assets, and we cannot afford to lose you.

Eternal Servant of Imix
