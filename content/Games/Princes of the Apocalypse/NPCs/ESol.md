Esol sent the following letter to [[Elizar Dryflagon]]:

My dear Elizar,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to you to express my concerns about the recent activities of the cult. I fear that we are losing sight of our original goals and becoming too obsessed with power and destruction. I know that you share my doubts and reservations, and I urge you to speak up and take action before itâ€™s too late. Remember that we are not just servants of [[Imix]], but also guardians of nature and protectors of the balance. Let us not forget our duty and our honor.

Yours truly,

[[ESol]]
